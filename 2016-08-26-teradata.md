We are NetNames Brand Protection Limited, a brand protection company. We have been instructed by our client, Teradata US, Inc. ("Teredata") – a subsidiary wholly owned by Teredata Corporation – to take action in relation to internet matters that infringe our client's Intellectual Property Rights. Please see the attached authorization letter.

Teradata is a data solution provider specializing in end-to-end solutions and services in data warehousing and big data and analytics and is the copyright owner of their bespoke software.

It has been brought to our attention that a user on rubygems.org has published gem files that have incorporated the copyrighted work owned by Teradata without any authorization – specifically we are referring to the Teradata owned jar files, terajbdc4.jar and tdgssconfig.jar.

Our client attempted to contact the admin of www.rubygems.org (please find attached for your reference) concerning the misuse, regrettably the admin has not responded to our client’s notification.

Upon investigation, we found that the site is hosted on IP: 54.186.104.15 which appears to be under your control; therefore, we kindly ask you to find below details required for DMCA takedown notice to process our complaint in order to have the infringing material removed from the site, www.rubgems.org .
